### Data Analysis
One of the most important ideas we want you to take from Module 2 is to think of a data set as a whole, not as individual points. 

In the “back-of-the-envelope” check you just did, you measured the spacing between a single, fixed number of nodes. But the “node number” provides us with an independent variable that we can control, so by measuring the position of multiple nodes, we can create a plot of position versus node number data. Plotting the data and looking at the data set as a whole gives us confidence in our ability to determine the speed of sound, since it allows us to fit the data to the theoretical prediction in a more robust way. You do not need beads in every node to use this method, but you do need to use sound judgement and consistency with the theory to appropriately assign the node numbers to your levitated beads. 

At the end of module 1 we introduced MATLAB and made use of it to fit a horizontal line of best fit. In this module we will continue to make use of MATLAB for data analysis. 

How do we extract a slope from our measured data? You have previously fit a horizontal line, but now you will fit a line with a nonzero slope. To understand this fitting process, you now need to carefully read the [curve fitting guide](curve-fitting){:target="_blank"}. In it you will find a MATLAB script that includes a linear fit with both an intercept and a slope.

To ensure you are prepared to analyze your data, please make use of the following figure to answer the subsequent mini-question.
