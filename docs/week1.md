### Introduction
In this module we will be working with a rather cool piece of home-built equipment, an acoustic levitator! We will be doing far more than floating objects, however. We will also be honing one of the most important skills, some may say arts, of an experimentalist: performing accurate and precise measurements. This may not sound all that exciting at face value but it is an incredibly important part of experimental science. The GPS on my phone may be able to tell me my location on a map, but how useful would it  be if it was only certain to a radius of 5 miles? Or what if it was consistently reporting a location that was 1 mile to the east of my actual location? Understanding how well we <em>truly</em> know the value of something, being able to increase the accuracy to be useful for our application, and being certain that we are actually measuring what we think we are measuring are fundamental to good scientific practice.

### Background Reading
This week in lab you will be working with a standing wave of sound to levitate small objects (cool!). Let us take a few minutes to understand how they work.

#### A Brief Review of Standing Waves
The acoustic levitators we will use in lab make use of standing waves of sound. Let us harken back to Ph 24 for a brief review of the basics of standing waves.

As you may recall, in a transverse wave the disturbance away from equilibrium, y, in a wave traveling in the x direction can be described by the equation $$y=Asin(k x-\omega t)=Asin(2\pi(\frac{x}{\lambda}-\nu t))$$ where $latex A$ is the maximum amplitude, $latex \nu=\frac{\omega}{2\pi}$ is the frequency, and $latex \lambda$ is the wavelength of the wave. The speed $$ v$$ of the wave is given by $$v=\lambda \nu.$$

In the case of a wave on a string the wave travels along the length of the string and the disturbance y is the displacement of bits of string perpendicular to the length. Imagine an apparatus that consists of a string held under constant tension; one end is attached to a mechanical oscillator that jiggles the string, creating a sine wave that propagates towards the other end which is fixed (imagine it is tied to a post). The wave then hits the fixed end and reflects, creating a sine wave that propagates back toward the oscillator in the opposite direction. We now have two waves traveling in opposite directions and what we observe will be the result of these two waves added together.

Recall that the superposition of two waves traveling in opposite directions can be represented by $$y_{total}(x,t)=Asin(k x-\omega t) + Asin(k x+\omega t +\phi)$$ where the reflected wave has the same maximum amplitude as the incident wave but has picked up a phase $$ \phi$$. Our combined wave can now be represented as $$y_{total}(x,t)=Asin(k x-\omega t) - Asin(k x+\omega t )$$ where we have made use of the fact that $latex sin(\theta+\pi) = -sin(\theta)$. Making use of one more fun fact, $$ sin(A + B)=sin(A)cos(B)+sin(B)cos(A)$$, and a little bit of algebra you can show that this simplifies to $$y_{total}(x,t)=-2Asin(\omega t)cos(kx)$$</p>

The takeaway from this is that the position and time dependence are now separate! It is as though the wave is fixed in space along the x axis while the effective "maximum amplitude" oscillates in time as $$ 2 A sin(\omega t)$$. This is known as a standing wave and is shown in the figure below.

If both ends of the string are fixed (or nearly so), this puts restrictions on the wavelengths and therefore the frequencies that will produce stable standing waves on a given string. In this example, our string can be thought of has having two fixed ends <strong>--nodes --</strong>a distance L apart.  The places where the string doesn’t move ($latex y_{total}=0$) are called <strong>nodes</strong>, whereas places where the string oscillates with maximum amplitude are called <strong>antinodes</strong>. Only particular wavelengths will allow both ends of the string to be nodes; the wavelengths and frequencies that produce this type of stable standing waves are called <strong>resonant.</strong> (Note:  We have arrived at this condition by considering the boundary conditions for the disturbance at the ends of the string.  An equivalent method would be to require that the twice-reflected wave after one round trip is perfectly in phase with the brand new wave just now being emitted by the oscillator.  This second method offers some insight into what happens when the oscillator frequency is <em>not</em> resonant:  the vibrations on the string will be unstable and tend to die out.)

What happens if instead of a fixed end we have a second mechanical oscillator shaking the string at the same frequency? We will end up with a standing wave but the ends will not be nodes and it will not be defined by a resonant condition, meaning we are free to pick any frequency. This is the situation we have in the acoustic resonator and we will revisit it in more detail in the following section.

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong><strong id="P1-5-2">P1.5.2</strong> Acoustic Levitator Theory
</strong>Air surrounds us all the time and it’s easy not to think about it at all, or to think of it as insubstantial.  But when a gust of wind blows over our beach umbrella, or a vacuum cleaner sucks up dust (or confetti, or popcorn…), it’s hard to ignore the fact that air molecules can exert force on other objects.  Specifically, these phenomena and many others involve net motion of many air molecules in response to a pressure difference.  In the case of the wind at the beach, the original pressure difference may be caused by weather patterns and by the contrasting temperature and motion of the water compared to the land.  In the case of the vacuum cleaner, the original pressure difference is caused by the vacuum action pulling air out of the canister.  Either way, air moves in response to the original disturbance, and can push solid objects as it goes.  Sound travels through air in a similar manner.  You bang on the table, and the vibrations in your hand and those on the table jiggle the nearby air.  This disturbance in the surrounding air creates a pressure wave in the air, which transmits outward and eventually vibrates your eardrums, which your ‘microphones’ (aka eardrums) interpret as a sharp bang.

Given that sound is motion of the air, might sound waves push and even levitate solid objects?  Indeed, this is the phenomenon of acoustic levitation, or ‘acoustophoresis,’ in which sound floats material objects.  The forces here are a bit more complicated than in the case of the beach umbrella or vacuum cleaner.  Both of those examples involved a steady or long-lasting pressure difference causing a sustained motion of the air in one direction.  As a sound wave passes through the air, however, the pressure in any given spot oscillates between high and low many times per second, but the vibrating air can still exert an overall force called acoustic radiation pressure.  We’ll discuss in more detail the various ingredients that go into acoustic levitation in a standing wave of sound.

First we’ll discuss the generation and propagation of a traveling wave of sound. Consider the following thought experiment. There is a speaker placed on a table, so that sound projects from the speaker to the ceiling. Suppose the speaker is attached to a function generator, and so outputs a noise with a constant frequency. The speaker operates by vibrating a `plate' up and down at the frequency set by the function generator, thus creating regular disturbances in the air, which your eardrums interpret as sound. These disturbances are <strong>longitudinal waves</strong>, which should be contrasted with <strong>transverse waves</strong>. Whereas a transverse wave vibrates in the direction <em>perpendicular</em> to the direction along which the wave is moving, longitudinal waves vibrate in the direction <em>along</em> the direction of motion of the wave. These distinctions are hopefully made clear by the following two GIFs. The left is a transverse wave while the right is a longitudinal wave like sound:

<img class="wp-image-1517" src="https://www.physics.hmc.edu/~physics50/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/transverse-longitudinal-waves2.gif" alt="" width="529" height="320" /> Above are animations of transverse (left) and longitudinal (right) travelling waves. Note the difference in the behavior of individual particles in each wave type. Sound waves are longitudinal and look like the right-hand picture. Animation credit D. Russell.

Electromagnetic waves are transverse. However, tsunami waves and slinky compression waves are longitudinal, as are sound waves.

<img class="wp-image-561" src="http://www.physics.hmc.edu/~physics50/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Water-2016.gif" alt="Water waves GIF" width="300" height="130" /> Fun fact! The waves you see at the surface of the water in the ocean, those which `break' at the beach, are called surface or circular waves since particles in them effectively move in circles, and are neither longitudinal nor transverse, but rather a combination of the two as illustrated above.

Now, the longitudinal waves created above the speaker have a regular pressure pattern. When the plate in the speaker is forced downwards, the air directly above the speaker is 'pulled' apart, creating a low pressure, or "rarefaction," region.<span style="color: #800080;"> </span>But when the plate is accelerated upwards, the air above is 'squeezed' together, forming a high pressure, or "compression," region. As individual air molecules move and collide, the pressure variations propagate upward as a travelling wave of sound.

We learned in the previous section that travelling waves of the same frequency, moving through the same material in opposite directions, can form a standing wave.  This can happen for sound as well.

The sinusoidal waves shown in the figure below represent the pattern of pressure variations in the air; they also looked exactly like the geometric shape of the string in our thought experiment above.  However, because sound waves are longitudinal, the actual motion of the air molecules looks geometrically a little different as shown in the figure below.


<img class="wp-image-1520" src="https://www.physics.hmc.edu/~physics50/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/standing-displacement-antinode-vert-cropped-4.gif" alt="" width="600" height="416" /> The above animation shows a standing pressure wave that is oscillating at its resonance frequency. In the left animation we see the air particles being driven back and forth, creating regions of high and low pressure. The middle animation shows the displacement from equilibrium of a particle as a function of position. The right animation represents the deviation from equilibrium pressure as a function of position. Note this pressure wave is oscillating about the equilibrium pressure, not zero pressure. Notice the motion of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">red particles</span> for various locations and how the displacement and pressure animations relate to that motion.

In the previous section our standing wave on a string was caused by a traveling wave in one direction, driven by a source, and the reflections of this original traveling wave at the ends of the string.  A standing wave of sound can be created in the same way, using a single traveling-wave source like a speaker at one end of the setup and a sound reflector, like a metal plate, at the other.  Standing waves set up in this way are called resonant standing waves.  In a given setup, they are possible only at certain frequencies because the reflected waves have to interfere in just the right way with one another – or to put it another way, an integer number of half-wavelengths must fit along the length of the setup.  However, at the right wavelengths or frequencies, resonant standing waves can be very strong even if the original driving source is relatively weak; the reason is again that resonant standing waves involve constructive interference of the original wave with the waves that have gone before it and completed one round trip, or two round trips (etc.), through the setup.

Resonant standing waves of sound are very common.  (To play with some, consult a friend with just about any non-electronic musical instrument.)  However, our setup this week will involve non-resonant standing waves of sound.  Remember that the key ingredients for a standing wave are two traveling waves in opposite directions.  In a non-resonant standing wave, we simply place one source at either end of the setup.  If the two sources are driven together – by the same signal -- they will produce traveling waves in opposite directions, of equal frequencies and amplitudes, creating a standing wave.  In a non-resonant standing wave, reflections of the original traveling waves are not crucial.  Therefore there are no specific frequency or wavelength requirements to make a standing wave ‘work’ in the setup (i.e., no harmonics).  However, since the original traveling waves don’t get ‘reused’ in the setup through multiple reflections, a non-resonant standing wave is generally not very strong unless the driving source itself is strong. You will see both of these features of non-resonant standing waves in the apparatus you will use this week.

In our acoustic levitator apparatus, the two sources are two sets of tiny speakers driven by the same electrical signal.  Each speaker set is arranged in a slightly concave bowl-like shape, and the two bowls face each other on opposite ends of a plastic frame.  The curved, concave shape of each source is a detail we haven’t yet discussed.  Its purpose is to shape the standing waves, making them focused and strongest in the middle of the apparatus.  The same thing is very commonly done for standing waves of light, with pairs of curved mirrors.  You can get a rough idea of how the curved surfaces produce curved wave patterns in the second half of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVWemRbgLW4">this</a> video.

ow does a standing wave of sound produce acoustic levitation?  Take a good look at the standing wave in the previous figure .  A standing wave of sound consists of “pressure antinodes,” fixed positions in space where the pressure <em>deviates the most from the equilibrium</em>, atmospheric value, and “pressure nodes,” fixed positions in space where the <em>pressure stays constant</em>.  You might imagine a small styrofoam bead placed in the standing wave, being pushed away from a pressure antinode when the pressure is high there, and then being pulled toward it when the pressure is low there.  This doesn’t sound like it creates stable trapping!  However, the key to acoustic radiation pressure is that the standing waves oscillate too fast for a big, heavy particle (even a styrofoam bead) to follow the cycles of push and pull in a simple way.  Instead, the air in each region pushes the particle with an effective force proportional to the time average of the square of the pressure, $latex &lt;p^2&gt;$.  There is a well-developed theoretical foundation for this force   <a href="#ref1">$latex ^2$</a><a href="#ref2">$latex ^3$</a> but we will not go into it here.  What’s important to note for now is that $latex &lt;p^2&gt;$ is larger at the pressure antinodes than at the pressure nodes, so particles are consistently pushed either to the pressure nodes or to the pressure antinodes.  Most solid particles are pushed to (and trapped in) the pressure nodes; the exact details depend on the density of the object compared to air and the speed of sound through the object.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #686868; font-size: 19px; font-style: italic;">The exact details of this theory<a href="#ref3">$latex ^4$</a> are immaterial for us (it's a good thing too, since it is very complicated!), the point is that we can discern the positions of the pressure nodes, and thus the locations at which (spherical) beads will levitate, using the above equation.</span>

In the case of a perfectly rigid sphere with density $latex &gt;&gt; $density of air, the acoustic 'levitation force' between the two plates is encapsulated by something called the <strong>Gor'kov potential</strong>, given by $$U = 2\pi R^3\left(\frac{\langle p^2\rangle}{3\rho c^2} - \frac{\rho\langle u^2\rangle }{2}\right).\tag{eqn. 1}\label{eq:gorkov}$$ Here, $latex R$ is the radius of the levitating sphere, $latex \rho$ the air density, $latex c$ the speed of sound in the air, and $latex \langle p^2\rangle$ and $latex \langle u^2\rangle$ the mean square amplitudes of the sound pressure and velocity, respectively. Similar to Newton's potential in orbital mechanics, or Coulomb's potential in electrostatics, levitating objects subject to the Gor'kov potential reside in positions where (\ref{eq:gorkov}) is a minimum.</span>
