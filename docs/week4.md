# Week 4: Communicating written scientific results, physics-style

In Physics 50, you will ultimately get to experience what it’s like to create a physics poster, which is like a mini version of a physics paper. In Module 1, you created a single figure with a caption. For the Module 2 deliverable, you will produce a series of figures, with captions, that summarize the method and logic you used, leading to your final result for the liquid viscosity in this module.  We repeat here the guidelines from Module 1 regarding each individual figure.

## A figure showing a plot

The most common way to present experimental data is to show a plot, usually with two axes and clearly marked data points with error bars. Most readers will expect to see the main experimental result expressed using a plot -- in fact this is so universal that physicists often refer to the central figure of their publication as “the money plot”!

The fundamental elements that a figure with a plot needs to be effective are:

*In the figure itself*

+ **Axes**, with axis labels, units, and tick marks in a font that is as big as the text in the caption and surrounding paragraphs. It is okay to label an axis using a mathematical symbol for a variable, as long as the symbol is defined with words in the caption.

+ **Data points**, with consistent data point symbols. If there is more than one data set in the plot, each data set should have its own symbol shape and color. These are typically described in the caption, not using a legend.

+ **Error bars**, attached to the individual data points and should match the color of the data point symbols.

+ **(optional) Additional markings:** If there are any additional symbols or marks in the figure that are not data points, they must be clearly separated from and visually distinct (in eg. shape, color) from the data point symbols.

*In the figure caption*

+ **Title sentence:** This short sentence (with a verb!) explains the point of what is shown in the figure. It tells the reader what your data mean and ideally this clearly connects to the main result (thesis) of the paper.

+ **(optional) Panel title:** If the figure has multiple panels (or an inset plot within the main plot), each panel or plot gets its own brief title. This is almost always a phrase, without a verb. For a panel with a plot, it is usually a statement of axis labels (see next bullet point).

+ **Statement of axis labels:** If any axes are labeled using mathematical symbols, those symbols must be defined using words in the caption.

+ **(optional) Definition of data point symbols:** If there is more than one data set shown in the plot, each data point symbol must be defined. Typically this is done in the caption, not in a legend.

+ **Definition of error bars:** The caption must define what the error bars represent (for example, they might represent [the standard error of the mean](uncertainty-introduction#random-uncertainty), or SEM).

+ **(optional) Definition of additional markings:** If there are any additional symbols or marks in the figure that are not data points, those symbols must be defined in the caption, not in a legend.

Here is an annotated example of a figure with a plot, taken from [this article](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.018002){:target="_blank"} in the journal Physical Review Letters. Note that the figure also contains some experimental images that help to convey the main point of the figure, but for the purposes of this lesson, we will just focus on the last panel of the figure, which contains a plot.

## A figure without a plot

Even figures that don’t have an explicit plot with data points still can present essential experimental data. Often data takes the form of photographs, microscope images, or other specialized images like those obtained from X-ray diffraction or magnetic resonance imaging. This kind of data can play a critical role in showing your experimental results, even without a traditional plot with labeled axes and clearly defined data points. 

You will recognize many of the same elements as for a figure with a plot, and some new ones:

In the figure itself

+ **Scale bar:** Any experimental images (eg. from a microscope) should be accompanied by a scale bar, which provides a sense of the size of the system studied. Usually a scale bar is a plain, thick horizontal line segment in black or white. The length of the scale bar is either written directly above or below the bar, or it is provided in the caption.

+ **(optional) Additional markings:** If there are any additional symbols or marks in the figure that are not data points, they must be visually distinct (in eg. shape, color) from the images shown in the figure.

*In the figure caption*

+ **Title sentence:** This short sentence (with a verb!) explains the point of what is shown in the figure. It tells the reader what your data mean and ideally this clearly connects to the main result (thesis) of the paper.

+ **(optional) Panel title:** If the figure has multiple panels, each panel gets its own brief title. This is almost always a phrase, without a verb. 

+ **(optional) Definition of scale bar:** If the scale bar length is not shown in the figure, it must be clearly defined in the caption.

+ **(optional) Definition of additional markings:** If there are any additional symbols or marks in the figure that are not data points, those symbols must be defined in the caption, not in a legend.

Here is an annotated example of a figure without a plot, taken from [this article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3632) in the journal *Nature Physics*. Again, this figure consists of many individual panels, some of which are obscured below to allow room for the annotations. To see the full figure in proper context, we encourage you to follow the link above to take a look at the original article.

## Module 2 Deliverable

What do I need to make for Module 2?

For Module 2, your deliverable is a series of two to four figures, summarizing the data and analysis you used (including the logic that drove your decisions) and leading up to your final result for the viscosity of the liquid in this module.  Keep in mind that your figures should make the overall process and results understandable to someone who has your physics background but who is not enrolled in this course and has not seen the experimental videos or read any of the instructions.  Your final result for the liquid viscosity (including uncertainty!) should be given somewhere in the last figure or its caption.
