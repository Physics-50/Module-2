# Week 4: Forming Conclusions and Communicating Results

--------------
1. [Experimental Iteration](#experimental-iteration)
2. [Week 4 Tasks](#week-4-tasks)
3. [Deliverable - Sequence of Figures](#deliverable)


Lab this week will focus on the preparation of your deliverable. You are still required to attend lab but are not required to collect any new data. You will have the opportunity to work on your deliverable in lab and receive feedback. You also have the opportunity to collect more data if there were issues with your data set; if your results differ from expectations or are inconsistent, you should seek to determine why.

This week's focus is on communicating your results through a sequence of figures.



## Week 4 Tasks

You have two tasks this week:

1. Generate a plot of wavelength vs. grating period (or grating frequency). This plot will have two data points) and fit a horizontal line as we did in Module 1 to generate your best estimate of the laser wavelength and its uncertainty from the plot.

2. Prepare a sequence of 2 figures with captions to submit for your deliverable. These figures will come directly from the work you have done in the preceding 3 weeks.



## <a name="deliverable">Deliverable --- A Sequence of Two Figures

Your Module 2 deliverable will consist of two figures. Each of these figures must include a caption following the guidelines provided for Module 1. We encourage you to refer back to the [figure preparation guide from Module 1](https://physics-50.github.io/Module-1/week3){:target="_blank"} and feedback you received on your module 1 deliverable. 

Before preparing a figure caption you should take a moment to ask yourself: “What do I want to convey to my reader?” and to further break that down into smaller questions. It is important to us at this stage in the course that you learn to recognize what is important so we are not going to provide an exhaustive list, but here are two questions to get you started:

+ What was my primary result from the experiment?
+ What would a fellow student, who hasn’t taken this course, need to know to look at my data and understand the key details of how they were collected?

These points are just the beginning of a list; can you think of more questions that might help you to focus on what might be important to convey to your reader? We would be happy to discuss your list of questions with you (in lab in week 4 or in office hours) before you begin writing your caption. After you’ve written the caption it is a good idea to look back to your list of questions and make sure that you answered them. 

Note that if the perspective of your experimental setup photo(s) makes it difficult to accurately define a reasonable scale bar, you can use something in the picture to provide a length scale. For example, if the caption indicates the length of the laser or the spacing of the grid marks, this would be sufficient to convey the length scale to the reader. 

The following should be submitted on Gradescope:

+ **Figure 1** is equivalent to the figure you submitted for Week 1, but with a caption that introduces the overall experimental setup and reports the salient details of the procedure you used. Your caption should also explain what you learned from your careful investigation of one potential source of error (diffraction grating angle) during Week 1.  We do not use the same rubric for the checkpoints and deliverables; if any issues were raised with your week 1 checkpoint---or even if they weren't but you feel you could present your results better---we encourage you to speak to us and make appropriate corrections before submitting your deliverable. 

+ **Figure 2** will also be a multi-panel figure. 
    - **Panel (a)** will showcase how you determined the wavelength. Namely, panel (a) will  **provide a single example plot of $$x$$ vs. $$L$$ for one of the diffraction grating periods.** 
    - **Panel (b)** will plot wavelength vs. grating period, so there will be two data point on this plot. You should make use of the [fitting script](https://physics.hmc.edu/fitter/) to fit a horizontal line ("kind" = "constant") and report the result with its uncertainty in your caption as your best estimate of the wavelength from your experimental data.   The caption should include your primary result (estimated wavelength quoted with uncertainty using appropriate significant figures) and should compare this value with the expected wavelength as quoted by the manufacturer (available on the sticker on the laser).
    
    
In all cases make sure your figure captions concisely include sufficient details to stand alone. Report that the error bars were determined from a combination of the SEM and resolution error, assuming that is true, and include the number of trials that contributed to each data point. Since resetting parameters such as the position/angle of the diffraction grating, $$L$$, or which diffraction grating was used were an important part of the experimental procedure for this experiment, you should describe this procedure in the caption as part of your description of the experimental procedure. **An HMC sophomore who has not taken Physics 50 should be able to look at your figures with captions and have a clear idea of what you did.** This means you should describe not only what we should take away from the plot but also the most salient details of the experiment itself.

+ You will be asked to upload some additional information for grading quality of data including some of your results and a link to your **well-organized** assigned spreadsheet

*Please note that you will need to upload each figure three times. You need to include both the figure and caption each time.*
