## Module 2 Overview 

### Learning Objectives

1. Minimize and account for several sources of error in an experiment, including random error, resolution uncertainty, and systematic error.
 
2. Perform a weighted fit of a theory-inspired function to a data set, and use it to draw conclusions.

In Module 2 we will use a ruler to (indirectly!) measure the wavelength of light and test a theory.

## Weekly Plan

In this module you will observe the diffraction of laser light through a many-slit *diffraction grating*, and use the spacing between diffraction maxima to measure the wavelength of the laser. We will continue to investigate sources of uncertainty and refine the process of comparing our results with expectations. 

Module 2 is four weeks long. Each week, except the last week, you will have a checkpoint due. These checkpoints will give us a chance to give you feedback as you work towards the Module 2 deliverable: a series of two figures that effectively communicates your results and key details of how the data was collected and analyzed. 

1. [Week 1 - Exploratory Phase](week1)
    - Checkpoint: a two-panel figure that showcases your results from exploring a significant source of systematic error in the experiment.
2. [Week 2 - Data Collection](week2)
    - Checkpoint: a figure showcasing your results from a 500 line/mm grating
3. [Week 3 - Further Data Collection](week3)
    - Checkpoint: a figure showcasing your results from a 1000 line/mm grating.    
<!-- 
Checkpoint: A figure that allows comparison of your results from the 500 line/mm and 1000 line/mm gratings.-->
4. [Week 4 - Scientific Communication Phase](week4)
    - Deliverable: a sequence of figures communicating your results from the module.
