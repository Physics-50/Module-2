## Module 2 Overview 

In this module you will observe the diffraction of light waves after passing through a pattern of regularly spaced barriers and openings (often called _slits_ in this context).  Measurements and analysis in this module will give you a taste of how diffraction can be used to learn about the structure of a periodic sample.  Week 1 reading introduces you to the relevant theory of wave diffraction and interference.


### Learning Objectives

1. Create and execute a measurement plan for accuracy and precision, based on exploratory observations. 

2. Perform a weighted fit of a theory-inspired function to a data set, and use it to draw conclusions.

3. Calculate a physical quantity based on experimental data and its uncertainty.

4. Record and communicate experimental results.
